                        <p class="font-medium text-md text-secondary md:text-lg">I have been living in Surabaya since now. Surabaya is the capital city of East Java Province, Indonesia, as well as the largest metropolitan city in the province. Surabaya is the second largest city in Indonesia after Jakarta. The city is located 800 km east of Jakarta, or 435 km northwest of Denpasar, Bali. Surabaya is located on the north coast of the eastern part of Java Island and is opposite the Madura Strait and the Java Sea. Surabaya is known as the City of Heroes because of its history which is very calculated in the struggle of Arek-Arek Suroboyo (Surabaya youths) in defending the independence of the Indonesian nation from colonial attacks. Surabaya was also the largest city in the Dutch East Indies and became a commercial center in the archipelago which was parallel to Hong Kong and Shanghai at that time.
